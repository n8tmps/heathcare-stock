<h2>Analysis</h2>
<h3>Stock Price and Moving Averages</h3>
<p>Data for each ticker symbol includes daily closing prices, which are aggregated over the past 5 years. Moving averages were calculated to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. Specifically, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages were computed for each stock. The plots reveal the historical stock prices for each ticker symbol, alongside their respective 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Trends and patterns in stock price movements can be observed, aiding in the interpretation of long-term performance.</p>

<h3>Weekly Returns</h3>
<p>Weekly returns are calculated to assess the performance of each stock over shorter time intervals. The weekly return is computed as the percent change in stock price from one week to the next. Weekly return plots depict the volatility and performance of each stock on a weekly basis. Fluctuations in weekly returns provide insights into the stock's sensitivity to market conditions and external factors.</p>

### Principal Component Analysis
The weekly rates of return for Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, UnitedHealth Group, Roche Holding AG, and AstraZeneca were determined for the period May 2019 through May 2024. The observations appear to be independently distributed, but the rates of return across stocks are correlated, because stocks tend to move together in response to general economic condtions.

Let $x_1, x_2, ..., x_5$ denote observed weekly rates of return. The sample mean vector and the sample correlation matrix are:

$\vec{\bar{x'}} = [0.000667, -0.000614, 0.003747, 0.000287, 0.003360]$

The principal components are:

$Y_1 = 0.4838X_1 + 0.4326X_2 + 0.4253X_3 + 0.4390X_4 + 0.4530X_5$<br>
$Y_2 = 0.2099X_1 + 0.3372X_2 + 0.5276X_3 -0.5694X_4 -0.4895X_5$<br>
$Y_3 = -0.0430X_1 + 0.7417X_2 -0.5976X_3 -0.2605X_4 + 0.1513X_5$<br>
$Y_4 = 0.8485X_1 -0.2943X_2 -0.4021X_3 -0.1274X_4 -0.1241X_5$<br>
$Y_5 = -0.0064X_1 -0.2499X_2 + 0.1476X_3 -0.6316X_4 + 0.7189X_5$

The proportion of the total sample variance explained by the first three principal components is computed as:

$(2.8737 + 0.7082 + 0.5809) / 5 = 0.83256$

- The first principal component is a measure of the rates of return for **JNJ**, **PFE**, **UNH**, **RHHBY**, and **AZN**.
- The second principal component is a measure of the rates of return for **UNH**, **RHHBY**, **AZN**, and to some extent, **JNJ**, and **PFE**.
- The third principal component is a measure of the rates of return for **PFE**, **UNH**, and to some extent, **RHHBY**.
